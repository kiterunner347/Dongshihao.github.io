It utilizes a half-edge data structure to store point and face information of the 3D model. The support structures are generated using the point and face information along with user-defined parameters. The results are displayed to the user through a graphical user interface (GUI), allowing for interactive interactions. This is a project involving a 3D printing support algorithm developed using MATLAB. We have created a GUI interface that allows users to adjust support parameters. Users can determine the surfaces for which supports are needed using “Input Angle,” control the support generation density with “Resolution,” and adjust the radius of support generation using “Support Radius.” Once the parameters are set, users can click on “Input File” to read the 3D printing file. The system stores point and face information in a half-edge data structure. Clicking on “Columnar Support” or “Tree Support” generates column-like or tree-like supports, respectively. “Support Section” generates cross-sectional information of the model. Tree-like support and column-like support are generated as shown in Fig 1.

This robot system mainly consists of a base, a platform, and three driving links. The motion platform of the parallel robot is supported by three arm structures with consistent kinematics. Each arm is composed of a sequential arrangement of a rotational joint (R), a drivable prismatic joint (P), and another rotational joint (R), connecting the mobile base and the robot motion platform. With respect to the mechanical structure model, we conducted kinematic and differential kinematic analysis as well as workspace visualization. In order to verify the structural strength of the model, ANSYS simulation analysis is used. The connection at the articulation is simplified, and the simplified model obtained is shown in Fig. 8. Finally, we conducted joint dynamic simulations of the model using a combination of Adams and MATLAB. Simple PD controllers showed poor tracking performance under different conditions, especially in the presence of measurement noise and external disturbances. To compensate for these effects, a feedforward term τ_f was added to the controller architecture. This term is obtained by computing the feedforward torque through the robotic arm’s dynamic model and mapping it into the joint space: https://github.com/kiterunner347/3-RPR-parallel--robot [1] A.

The project includes four parts: image recognition, LiDAR perception, trajectory planning and vehicle control. The purpose of developing the virtual test environment is to simulate and verify the vehicle control strategy based on the perception virtual environment. However, due to the limited time, only the offline testing of the perception part is realized. The virtual environment is shown in Fig 1. The main work of this paper is image recognition, using cameras to obtain road information and multi-target recognition, including lane lines, pedestrians and vehicles. The project uses the image obtained by OpenCV to process and estimate the distance between the lane line and the vehicle. The lane line is marked by the lavender color in the lower left corner. The combination of YOLOv5+DeepSort was adopted to detect pedestrians and vehicles. Pedestrians and vehicles were selected by the green box in the upper left corner.","link":"/2021/06/03/car/"},{"title":"Kinematics analysis of Siasun-SR10A-Robot and Simulink force feedback control simulation","text":"In this project, D-H modeling method is used to conduct mathematical modeling for the industrial six-axis robot arm, and the forward kinematics and reverse kinematics of the robot arm are solved. On this basis, the admittance controller based on the end sensor is designed, and the simulation of SINMULINK force position hybrid control in the end peg-in-hole assembly process is completed, as shown in Fig 1. In the process of peg-in-hole assembly, a hybrid control of force position is adopted. The diagonal selection matrix S determines the specific control mode, P and W represent the position control law and the force control law respectively, and U represents the controller output, as shown in Fig 2. The peg-in-hole assembly is divided into the approach stage (position control), the hole search stage (force position mixed control) and the jack stage (force control), the hole search stage needs to ensure that the Z-axis direction of the shaft and the plane contact is a constant contact force of the flexible control.

This also addresses the current challenges in the logistics industry regarding efficient mechanized automated sorting. Our project is based on the Model T robotic hand proposed by Yale University’s OpenHand project team [5], with additional functionalities and improvements made to the mechanical structure, specifically tailored for the complex sorting scenarios in large-scale e-commerce warehouses. Model diagrams and physical images are depicted in the figure. The servo motor controls the positions of Finger A and Finger B, enabling two gripping modes: parallel grasping (AB fingers together) or separate grasping (AB fingers apart). In this setup, both Finger A and Finger B are controlled by a single motor, referred to as Motor A. The underactuated grasping is achieved through a differential mechanism composed of a linear drive and pulley system. [1] R. R. Ma, L. U. Odhner and A. M.
