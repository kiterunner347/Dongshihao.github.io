{"posts":[{"title":"3D printing data processing and support generation algorithm based on MATLAB","text":"Based on MATLAB, this algorithm processes 3D printing data and generates supports. It utilizes a half-edge data structure to store point and face information of the 3D model. The support structures are generated using the point and face information along with user-defined parameters. The results are displayed to the user through a graphical user interface (GUI), allowing for interactive interactions. This is a project involving a 3D printing support algorithm developed using MATLAB. We have created a GUI interface that allows users to adjust support parameters. Users can determine the surfaces for which supports are needed using “Input Angle,” control the support generation density with “Resolution,” and adjust the radius of support generation using “Support Radius.” Once the parameters are set, users can click on “Input File” to read the 3D printing file. The system stores point and face information in a half-edge data structure. Clicking on “Columnar Support” or “Tree Support” generates column-like or tree-like supports, respectively. “Support Section” generates cross-sectional information of the model. Tree-like support and column-like support are generated as shown in Fig 1. GitHub Link Here.","link":"/2022/06/03/3D/"},{"title":"Simulation and analysis of 3-RPR parallel robot","text":"[1] A.

On this basis, the admittance controller based on the end sensor is designed, and the simulation of SINMULINK force position hybrid control in the end peg-in-hole assembly process is completed, as shown in Fig 1. In the process of peg-in-hole assembly, a hybrid control of force position is adopted. The diagonal selection matrix S determines the specific control mode, P and W represent the position control law and the force control law respectively, and U represents the controller output, as shown in Fig 2. The peg-in-hole assembly is divided into the approach stage (position control), the hole search stage (force position mixed control) and the jack stage (force control), the hole search stage needs to ensure that the Z-axis direction of the shaft and the plane contact is a constant contact force of the flexible control.

This also addresses the current challenges in the logistics industry regarding efficient mechanized automated sorting. Our project is based on the Model T robotic hand proposed by Yale University’s OpenHand project team [5], with additional functionalities and improvements made to the mechanical structure, specifically tailored for the complex sorting scenarios in large-scale e-commerce warehouses. Model diagrams and physical images are depicted in the figure. The servo motor controls the positions of Finger A and Finger B, enabling two gripping modes: parallel grasping (AB fingers together) or separate grasping (AB fingers apart). In this setup, both Finger A and Finger B are controlled by a single motor, referred to as Motor A. The underactuated grasping is achieved through a differential mechanism composed of a linear drive and pulley system. [1] R. R. Ma, L. U. Odhner and A. M.
